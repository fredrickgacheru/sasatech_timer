# Hello User


If you are reading this then I have impressed you enough to use this application. Please go through this carefully inorder tp understand the intricacies of the making and use of the application.

This application is  made from a point of love, and i liked and enjoyed making the application.

This has been made specifically to allow the user to use the timer, while recording the time of starting and the time of stopping. The application also forces the user to insert a password when reseting the timer and also to close the application in order to block the user from cancelling the record that the timer has. 

The timer is pretty basic in its use, and it is simple to use and apply. However, during installation, there is a high chance that your antivirus will identify it as a virus and attempt to block installation, which is why when running the installer, it is important to turn off the antivirus before installation.

> The password is **Antoh** and **Freddie**, with repect to me and my friend.

The code is very easy to read and undertstand. I wish you all the best as you use the code.
